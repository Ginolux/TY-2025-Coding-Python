# Example 1 - Create and print a dictionary

# thisdict = {
#   "brand": "Ford",
#   "model": "Mustang",
#   "year": 1964
# }
# print(thisdict)



# # Example 2 - Print the "brand" value of the dictionary

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])




# # Example 3 - You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets

# thisdict = {
#   "brand": "Ford",
#   "model": "Mustang",
#   "year": 1964
# }
# x = thisdict["model"]
# print(x)
