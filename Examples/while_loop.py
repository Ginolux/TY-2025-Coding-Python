# Example 1 - Print i as long as i is less than 6

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1



# # Example 2 - With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true

# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#   print(i)
#   if i == 3:
#     break
#   i += 1



# # Example 3 - Continue to the next iteration if i is 3

# i = 0
# while i < 6:
#   i += 1
#   if i == 3:
#     continue
#   print(i)
