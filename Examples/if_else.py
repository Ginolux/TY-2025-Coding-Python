# Example 1 

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")



# # Example 2 - The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

# a = 33
# b = 33
# if b > a:
#   print("b is greater than a")
# elif a == b:
#   print("a and b are equal")



# # Example 3 - The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

# a = 200
# b = 33
# if b > a:
#   print("b is greater than a")
# elif a == b:
#   print("a and b are equal")
# else:
#   print("a is greater than b")
